As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, statistics, information science, mathematics, data visualization, information visualization, data sonification, data integration, graphic design, complex systems, communication and business.1011) Statistician Nathan Yau, drawing on Ben Fry, also links data science to numan-computer interaction: users should be able to intuitively control and explore data.(12/[13] In 2015, the American Statistical Association identified database management, statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional communities.14) Relationship to statistics Many statisticians, including Nate Silver, have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another name for statistics.[15] Others argue that data science is distinct from statistics because it focuses on problems and techniques unique to digital data.16] Vasant Dhar writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. In contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g. from images, text, sensors, transactions or customer information, etc) and emphasizes prediction and action.[17] Andrew Gelman of Columbia University has described statistics as a nonessential part of data science.(18) Stanford professor David Donoho writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.(19 "

Individual agents may include, for\nexample, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. Macroeconomics analyzes the economy as a system\nwhere production, consumption, saving, and investment interact, and factors affecting it: employment of\nthe resources of labour, capital, and land, currency inflation, economic growth, and public policies that\nhave impact on these elements.\nOther broad distinctions within economics include those between positive economics, describing \"what\nis\", and normative economics, advocating \"what ought to be\"; between economic theory and applied\neconomics; between rational and behavioural economics; and between mainstream economics and\nheterodox economics.\nThe earlier term for the discipline was 'political economy', but since the late 19th century, it has\ncommonly been called 'economics'.[20] The term is derived from the Ancient Greek \n\u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2\n(oikonomikos), \"practiced in the management of a household or family\" and therefore \"frugal, thrifty\",\nwhich in turn comes from \n\u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 (\noikonomia) \"household management\" which in turn comes from\n\u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 (\noikos \"house\") and \n\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (\nnomos, \"custom\" or \"law\").[21][22][23][24]\nThere are a variety of modern definitions of economics; some reflect evolving views of the subject or\ndifferent views among economists.[25][26] Scottish philosopher Adam Smith (1776) defined what was\nthen called political economy as \"an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations\", in\nparticular as:\na branch of the science of a statesman or legislator [with the twofold objectives of providing] a plentiful\nrevenue or subsistence for the people ... [and] to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue for the\npublick services.[27]\nJean-Baptiste Say (1803), distinguishing the subject from its public-policy uses, defined it as the science\nof production, distribution, and consumption of wealth.[28] On the satirical side, Thomas Carlyle (1849)\ncoined \"the dismal science\" as an epithet for classical economics, in this context, commonly linked to the\npessimistic analysis of Malthus (1798).[29] John Stuart Mill (1844) defined the subject in a social context\nas:\nThe science which traces the laws of such of the phenomena of society as arise from the combined\noperations of mankind for the production of wealth, in so far as those phenomena are not modified by the\npursuit of any other object.[30]\nAlfred Marshall provided a still widely cited definition in his textbook Principles of Economics (1890)\nthat extended analysis beyond wealth and from the societal to the microeconomic level:\nEconomics is a study of man in the ordinary business of life. It enquires how he gets his income and how\nhe uses it. Thus, it is on the one side, the study of wealth and on the other and more important side, a part\nof the study of man.[31]",
        "1": "Lionel Robbins (1932) developed implications of what has been termed \"[p]erhaps the most commonly\naccepted current definition of the subject\":[26]\nEconomics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce\nmeans which have alternative uses.[32]\nRobbins described the definition as not classificatory in \"pick[ing] out certain kinds of behaviour\" but\nrather analytical in \"focus[ing] attention on a particular aspect of behaviour, the form imposed by the\ninfluence of scarcity.\"[33] He affirmed that previous economists have usually centred their studies on the\nanalysis of wealth: how wealth is created (production), distributed, and consumed; and how wealth can\ngrow.[34] But he said that economics can be used to study other things, such as war, that are outside its\nusual focus. This is because war has as the goal winning it (as a sought after end), generates both cost and\nbenefits; and, resources (human life and other costs) are used to attain the goal. If the war is not winnable\nor if the expected costs outweigh the benefits, the deciding actors (assuming they are rational) may never\ngo to war (a decision) but rather explore other alternatives. We cannot define economics as the science\nthat studies wealth, war, crime, education, and any other field economic analysis can be applied to; but, as\nthe science that studies a particular common aspect of each of those subjects (they all use scarce resources\nto attain a sought after end).\nSome subsequent comments criticized the definition as overly broad in failing to limit its subject matter to\nanalysis of markets. From the 1960s, however, such comments abated as the economic theory of\nmaximizing behaviour and rational-choice modelling expanded the domain of the subject to areas\npreviously treated in other fields.[35] There are other criticisms as well, such as in scarcity not accounting\nfor the macroeconomics of high unemployment.[36]\nGary Becker, a contributor to the expansion of economics into new areas, described the approach he\nfavoured as \"combin[ing the] assumptions of maximizing behaviour, stable preferences, and market\nequilibrium, used relentlessly and unflinchingly.\"[37] One commentary characterizes the remark as\nmaking economics an approach rather than a subject matter but with great specificity as to the \"choice\nprocess and the type of social interaction that [such] analysis involves.\" The same source reviews a range\nof definitions included in principles of economics textbooks and concludes that the lack of agreement\nneed not affect the subject-matter that the texts treat. Among economists more generally, it argues that a\nparticular definition presented may reflect the direction toward which the author believes economics is\nevolving, or should evolve.[26]\nAccording to economist Ha-Joon Chang economics should be defined not in terms of its methodology or\ntheoretical approach but in terms of its subject matter. Ha-Joon Chang finds a definition like \"the science\nwhich studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative\nuses\" very peculiar because all other sciences define themselves in terms of the area of inquiry or object\nof inquiry rather than the methodology. In the biology department, they don't say that all biology should\nbe studied with DNA analysis. People study living organisms in many different ways, so some people will\ndo DNA analysis, others might do anatomy, and still others might build game theoretic models of animal\nbehavior. But they are all called biology because they all study living organisms. According to Ha Joon",
        "2": "Chang, this view that you can and should study the economy in only one way (for example by studying\nonly rational choices), and going even one step further and basically redefining economics as a theory of\neverything, is very peculiar.[38]\nReferenced from WikiPedia."
