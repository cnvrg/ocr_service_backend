You can use this blueprint to immediately extract text from your pdfs. This blueprint works for scanned as well as digital pdfs. For using this pretrained Text Extraction model, you will need to create a ready-to-use API-endpoint that can be integrated with your data and application, in minutes.

1. Click on `Use Blueprint` button
2. In the pop up, choose the relevant compute you want to use to deploy your API endpoint
3. You will be redirected to your endpoint
4. You can now use the `Try it Live` section with any pdf.
5. You can now integrate your API with your code using the integration panel at the bottom of the page.
6. You will now have a functioning API endpoint that returns the text in pdfs!
